# Okay-POS

Okay-POS is a small front-end project I made up to learn about a few technologies I'm interested in:
- ***Svelte:*** A front-end component-based JS framework used for creating reactive user-interfaces. Unlike virtual-DOM frameworks (like React or Vue), it compiles down to 'vanilla' JS code during the build step. This code updates the DOM when app state changes.
- ***Tailwind CSS:*** So nice, I love it ðŸ˜Š
- ***Graphql:*** A query language for APIs
- ***Hasura:*** Automatically creates a graphql API based on a database schema. Can be run locally, but in this case I used the 'cloud' edition.


### *~ A Few Thoughts:*
Svelte proved to be very easy to pick up considering I had little front-end experience. I can understand why it's topping the web framework category on the [Stack Overflow Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-webframe-love-dread).

Tailwind also proved to be very easy to pick up. It's quite intuitive and very composable. Looking forward to using it again, there are so many other nice features.
